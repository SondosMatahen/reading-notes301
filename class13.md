## Sending form data
* Client/server architecture;
a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

* On the client side: defining how to send the data:
when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are action and method.
   * The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form â€” the current page.
   * The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method
   * The GET method:The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.
   * It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.
<br>
<br>

* HTTP requests are never displayed to the user (if you want to see them, you need to use tools such as the Firefox Network Monitor or the Chrome Developer Tools)
* If you need to send a password (or any other sensitive piece of data), never use the GET method or you risk displaying it in the URL bar, which would be very insecure. If you need to send a large amount of data, the POST method is preferred because some browsers limit the sizes of URLs. In addition, many servers limit the length of URLs they accept.

## On the server side: retrieving the data:
Whichever HTTP method you choose, the server receives a string that will be parsed in order to get the data as a list of key/value pairs. The way you access this list depends on the development platform you use and on any specific frameworks you may be using with it.
* Django for Python (a bit more heavyweight than Flask, but with more tools and options).
* Express for Node.js.
* Laravel for PHP.
* Ruby On Rails for Ruby.

All data that comes to your server must be checked and sanitized. Always. No exception.

* Escape potentially dangerous characters. The specific characters you should be cautious with vary depending on the context in which the data is used and the server platform you employ, but all server-side languages have functions for this. Things to watch out for are character sequences that look like executable code (such as JavaScript or SQL commands).
* Limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what's necessary.
* Sandbox uploaded files. Store them on a different server and allow access to the file only through a different subdomain or even better through a completely different domain.
